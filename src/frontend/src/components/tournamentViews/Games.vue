<!-- TODO: 
 + fill as per wireframe
 + list games per field via api calls or localstorage
 + maybe create "editable Game"- component for listing Games
    because user should be able to change Game State
    => so when clicking on it, should open a Game-Editor where 
        points can be changed (maybe as router-links to a GameEdit.vue component)
